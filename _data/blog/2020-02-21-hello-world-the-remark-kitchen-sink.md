Lunchclub is a networking platform matching you with professionals with similar interests and organizing short calls between you.

Something that really stands out about the overall experience is how encouraging they are, but there are a few interactions that work against that.

The whole website is encouraging you at every step.  Even for shy people like me, I felt calm about meeting new people, and excited to see who I'd meet.  I got the sense these aren't the people you'd normally meet at networking events.

I invited friends to join, and had some \[great] meetings with new people. I'd even earned some Lunchclub coins.



By the second week, I was setting up my availability for potential meetings and I saw this:



I got excited at the prospect of earning more coins. Not that I initially wanted to fill up my days with meetings, but dopamine makes us do strange things.

But then the brakes were slammed on the dopamine rush.
"To have more meetings you need to earn 10 Clubpoints."



    Only then it became clear - the virtual coins were the cost of the extra meetings, not earned by participating in them.

I felt a bit thrown off. The tables had turned. But hey, there's no such thing as a free lunch, right?

I undertsand it's not healthy for the user to fill their day with video calls, and not great for the platform if a few hard-core networkers take it over.  The purpose of the coin system is to encourage being selective about your meetings, which makes them higher quality.

The problem with this implementation is that overall experience is encouraging you to participate, and here there's a sudden flip to discouraging too much participation.

Clearing up copy could reduce the gap between expectations and reality, like so:



It still got me thinking though, why did I expect it to be gaining points?  Well, virtual coins are usually assumed to be a reward, so that's part of it.  The overall experience is characterised by encouraging people to connect with others.

I'd be interested in a little research here, to better understand how to navigate users through this meeting selection stage.  I'd like to look at a cohort analysis, dividing users that hit the meeting limit and those that don't. Are there differences in churn or satisfaction?  I'd talk to 3 or 4 people from each group to understand how they're deciding on what meetings to have next and look for repeating patterns.

That would be a quick research project that would help the whole team keep the entire experience consistent.

They do a great job of nurturing participation, so they need to be careful that each interaction builds on that.
