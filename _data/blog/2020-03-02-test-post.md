Did we just win our category at the UXResult Hackathon?!

I'm so happy that my team just won the Gestational Diabetes challenge at the [UXResult Hackathon!](https://uxresult.com/)

This is my first time being responsible for user research on a 
project, so I thought I'd share my experience and the findings that 
helped inform our design decisions.

## Friday 12 PM - Forum research

I started with Amy Hoy's Safary method looking through a bunch of forums
 and looking for pain points. Gestational Diabetes is temporary diabetes
 when you're pregnant so the regular Diabetes pps are too complicated, 
whereas fitness apps don't track blood sugar. So there's a lot of 
frustration using multiple apps. But the most obvious and talked about 
pain point revolved around cravings. It's notable (and weird) that most 
Diabetes apps pretend the cravings don't exist.

## Friday 2PM - Reddit post

We also asked them to make sure we had the whole picture. I took a 
bit of time thinking about the wording about this post. Since I'm new to
 Reddit and wanted to have something that will inspire people to answer 
quickly. We learned that there is constant decision fatigue planning and
 replanning your meals. No one plan works forever, - people get bored 
eating the same thing over and over. And sometimes even the same meals 
stop working without any explanation.

## Friday 5PM - Present initial research

The team gathered on a video call and I presented the research talking 
them through the key points of my notes. We also had an interview with a
 medical student who works with gestational diabetes patients. From this
 we learned that patients still record their meals and blood sugar 
levels on paper which is difficult for doctors because they need to see 
where the spikes are to see what diet led to them. 
After this we diverged, each of us independently coming up with paper 
wireframes and visual prototypes. Â

By this time we had started working together and came up with a flow. 
We've seen lots of women are anxious because their bodies are changing 
and they don't know if they're eating right.They're also confused when 
there's blood sugar spike and they can't figure out why. So we added 
this data tab, so they can quickly see which meals had an effect on 
their blood sugar.

We had also seen that women feel guilty. It's hard to stick to a diet, 
even harder when you have diabetes and even harder again with pregnancy 
cravings. And diabetic all know that they have cheat days, but for 
someone with Gestational diabetes their diet also affects their child. 
So we needed to help them change up their meals while making sure the 
whole experience was free of judgement. 

Working with this team has been my best collaboration experience in 
years! At first I was nervous, being the only person with research 
experience, but not having any visual and interaction design skills. 
Everybody did what was needed, nobody dragged out the process. When 
Anrdew suggested the Diverge/Converge approach everyone just jumped in. 
It was nice to be on a team with such well balanced skills. Andrew on UX
 process and prototyping, Sam on visual design and illustrations, Archie
 on interaction design and front-end development. It made me feel like 
my research work was understood and appreciated. 

I've been procrastinating working on projects for my portfolio, 
feeling not good enough yet. Thanks to this experience I feel more 
confident and excited to just pick a project and play around with it.
